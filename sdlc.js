// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain




//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each
     variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "In this step the software developers need to figure out how to build what the customer is asking for and what they will need to do to get there"
const Design = "The design step is about taking the requirements for the project and putting in into code"
const Implementation = "In the implementaion process is when the software is put into action for use"
const testingIntegration = "The software is tested to check for any bugs and to see if they need to make any last minute changes."
const maintain = "Maintaining the software is making sure future bugs are dealt with and adding new features to the software if needed"
